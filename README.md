## 🧑‍💻 About me
- 🧑‍💻 I started programming when I was 15, inspired by the game Habbo Hotel, with the dream of creating my own server. After many hours watching online tutorials and studying PHP and MySQL, I learned how to set up a VPS and finally managed to get the server up and running. It was my own "Habbo"! However, the server didn't attract many players, and I realized that what really motivated me was the idea of ​​building a community. So I created a Habbo Hotel fan site, with a radio with announcers, a blog with news about the game and a forum for players to interact. In the first month, the site received over 15 thousand visits, and it was at that moment that I fell in love with programming and creating online communities.
- 💚 After years of learning programming, I stepped away for personal reasons and outside of Brazil I discovered that my greatest passion is creating solutions for society/market and creating communities loyal to the product.
- 🚀 Currently, my main focus in my career is web and mobile development. I use the JavaScript stack (Node, React & React Native) to develop on both fronts.
- 🤖 I am passionate about AI and how it can help us automate processes and analyze data to better serve society. Today, many of my projects involve AI in some way. Today, I dedicate part of my knowledge to creating AI.
